    descriptionLarge: "I worked on John Wick 4 as a compositor, focusing on cleanup, element integration, and greenscreen removal. My tasks included painting out unwanted elements, seamlessly blending CG and practical assets into live-action plates, and performing precise chromakey work to ensure clean extractions and smooth composites. Working on such a high-action, visually stylized film demanded both technical precision and a strong eye for cinematic detail.",

I was responsible for complex cleanup work, including the removal of a full hand in several shots. This required detailed paint and prep work, frame-by-frame adjustments, and maintaining the continuity of motion and lighting in the affected areas. It was a challenging and rewarding introduction to high-end film compositing, pushing both my technical and creative problem-solving skills.",

      "In this project, I built a fully functional to-do application using Next.js for the frontend and EJS for templating where needed. On the backend, I used JavaScript with Objection.js as the ORM and Knex.js for query building and migrations. The app allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, with all data stored in a relational database. This project helped me deepen my understanding of routing, server-side rendering, and database modeling using a modular and scalable approach.",
